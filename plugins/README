README

Documentation on plugins for ISI_analysisGUI.

To add a plugin, create a directory within the /plugins/ folder. Within the new folder, create
an .m file with the same name as your directory. This file is by default executed by
ISI_analysis.GUI when you run a plugin from the GUI.

At startup, the GUI scans the /plugins/ folders and populates a pop-up menu with the names of
all sub-folders contained therein.
