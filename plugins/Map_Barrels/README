README on barrel_map_reconstruction_tool

The barrel_map_reconstruction_tool is an add-on to the ISI_analysis toolkit. Briefly, the tool;

 - collects all .mat files generated by ISI_analysis
 - produces a max/min projection of all individual barrel maps
 - plots different representations of the all-barrel map onto a vessel reference images
 - transforms the all-barrel map to project onto reference images taken with a different modality (e.g. 2P, post-op images etc)
